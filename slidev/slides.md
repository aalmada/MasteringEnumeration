# Enumeration

- Control
  - Pull - The consumer controls the pace of enumeration by explicitly requesting elements.
  - Push - The producer controls the pace of enumeration by actively pushing elements.
- Order
  - Sequential - The elements are accessed in a specific order, following a predetermined sequence.
  - Random - The elements are accessed in a non-sequential or arbitrary order, without a predetermined sequence.
